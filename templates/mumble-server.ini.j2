# Murmur configuration file.
#
# General notes:
# * Settings in this file are default settings and many of them can be overridden
#   with virtual server specific configuration via the Ice or DBus interface.
# * Due to the way this configuration file is read some rules have to be
#   followed when specifying variable values (as in variable = value):
#     * Make sure to quote the value when using commas in strings or passwords.
#        NOT variable = super,secret BUT variable = "super,secret"
#     * Make sure to escape special characters like '\' or '"' correctly
#        NOT variable = """ BUT variable = "\""
#        NOT regex = \w* BUT regex = \\w*
